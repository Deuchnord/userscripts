# Userscripts

This repository contains userscripts I have written for my own use.
They are distributed on [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/).

- **All sites:**
    - **[Redirect from mobile](https://greasyfork.org/fr/scripts/492838-redirect-from-mobile):** redirect automatically from the mobile version to the desktop version of websites.

- **github.com:**
    - **[Merge issues and PR tabs](https://greasyfork.org/fr/scripts/460294-merge-issues-and-pr-tabs):** merge the repositories _Issues_ and _Pull requests_ tabs in a single one that contains both open issues and PRs.

- **google.com:**
    - **[Bypass the redirection notice](https://greasyfork.org/fr/scripts/458539-bypass-the-redirection-notice):** when using Google apps from a third-party application, clicking links inside will show a warning page. This userscript bypasses it.

- **korii.slate.fr:**
    - **[Fix Korii's redability](https://greasyfork.org/fr/scripts/494381-fix-korii-s-redability):** fix the objectively hideous colors of [Korii](https://korii.slate.fr) to make it a little more accessible. PLEASE, Slate, do something, your website is a pain to read, and I don't even have any big visual impairmentâ€¦
